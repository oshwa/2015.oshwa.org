										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><b>What do you plan to do at this years OHS?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Catch up! I haven&#8217;t had a chance to attend OHS the last couple of years and really wish I had made it to Rome, so this year I want to listen to what other people have been up to and learn from them, catch up with old friends and acquaintances and shoot the s#&amp;% with likeminded individuals. </span></p>
<p><b>What&#8217;s your most used OS, electronic or component?</b></p>
<p>GSM modules, you know, AT commands are so satisfying. My multimeter would be next in line. I wish on the OS side I could say Ubuntu, but I am still working on making my full move over to Linux.</p>
<p><b>Favorite website of the moment?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I listen to my news and read physical books for the most part, so the internet for me is for research and window shopping <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> So I would have to admit that I am a total Pinterest and Etsy junkie. And Reddit, of course.   </span></p>
<p><b>What are you working on or thinking about right now?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have been doing a lot of thinking over the summer about the next chapter of my life, too deep I know. So I have been doing a lot of thinking around what got me interested in humanitarian applications of technologies in the first place and trying to find ways to get back to that. Basically I have been researching disaster relief and emergency response and hoping to specialize in those moving forward, while resisting the temptation of getting a PhD.  </span></p>
<p><b>What&#8217;s your favorite junk food?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh god, all of them?! If you opened my fridge you would be misled into thinking I have healthy eating habits, but I have hidden and not so hidden stashes of CHOCOLATE everywhere.  </span></p>
<p><b>How can we find out more about you?</b></p>
<p>I am a fairly private individual these days and suffer from constant impostor syndrome so my personal website is in need of revamping as it talks about my previous life, my current website is non existent (yet) and I rarely tweet other than at conferences. LinkedIn is the only page that is somewhat kept up to date. There are bits and pieces of my work splattered in cyberspace but the best way to learn about me is by reaching out via email, talking to me at events or coming to visit me at my current office at ITP NYU.</p>
<p><b>Can you share a picture of what describes you? </b></p>
<p>Couldn&#8217;t chose between 2:</p>
<p>My 2 passions (and &#8220;jobs&#8221;).</p>

<p>5.40am in the Maasai Mara, Kenya, fixing and troubleshooting electronics, of course</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">We are thrilled to welcome Mike Linksvayer to the Open Hardware Summit, where he will be discussing the new Creative Commons 4.0 license and its utility as part of his talk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mike is an advisor for Creative Commons and worked on the most recent 4.0 revision. He writes that hardware design is a field with “fragmented licensing, including use of CC licenses” and has written extensively on </span><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/12/09/scc-cc-40/"><span style="font-weight: 400">these</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2012/05/12/gpl-semi/"><span style="font-weight: 400">related topics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Mike also helps “promote, improve, develop, and defend Free, Libre, and Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects” as a board member of the </span><a href="https://sfconservancy.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Software Freedom Conservancy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. According to Mike, “we should want software to feed the world and our things to be benevolent &#8212; and not just the software we directly use and things we have on or in our bodies and homes, but also the software and things around us”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mike will be discussing the many benefits of the new Creative Commons 4.0 licenses, and which types of licenses and policies might be most appropriate for hardware designs. Interested in starting education and collaborative software development events in your own community? He can show you how. Mike is also a board member of </span><a href="https://openhatch.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400">OpenHatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, which is a non-profit dedicated to matching prospective free software contributors with communities, tools, and education. He supports an open-source approach to many aspects of innovation and society, believing that a “broad implementation of open source principles can increase freedom, equality, and security simultaneously, each of which is often held to be in tension if not outright conflict with the others”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We interviewed Mike, discussing his most recent work and views on open innovation. You can read the full interview below. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Would you tell us a bit more about the main project(s) you’re involved in, with Creative Commons, in the open source community, and/or in other areas?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I worked for Creative Commons 2003-2011 on all manner of projects but the last few years I&#8217;ve only been an advisor, primarily on CC&#8217;s version 4.0 licenses (released at the end of 2013) and increasing compatibility among certain CC and non-CC licenses (ongoing).  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I </span><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2013/12/09/scc-cc-40/"><span style="font-weight: 400">blogged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> my </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">personal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> take on the CC 4.0 licenses, which includes a bit on compatibility and open hardware licensing. I’m on the boards of </span><a href="https://sfconservancy.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Software Freedom Conservancy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><a href="https://openhatch.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400">OpenHatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Conservancy is a charitable non-profit organizational host for free/open source projects and also does GPL enforcement (currently we&#8217;re </span><a href="http://sfconservancy.org/news/2015/mar/05/vmware-lawsuit/"><span style="font-weight: 400">sponsoring a lawsuit against VMware</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> ; </span><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2015/03/05/gpl-lovers-haters-exploiters-enforce/"><span style="font-weight: 400">my personal take on that</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> ) and education about the GPL and other copyleft licenses &#8212; my </span><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2014/12/01/copyleft-org/"><span style="font-weight: 400">draft chapter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> about how CC-BY-SA for Conservancy&#8217;s copyleft.org site/book also makes mention of copyleft hardware licensing. Clearly copyleft hardware licensing merits a dedicated chapter; if anyone reading this is interested in contributing, collaborating on, or re-purposing existing material (under a CC-BY-SA compatible license!) to this project, please get in touch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">OpenHatch helps make it easier for newcomers to get involved in open source projects, including through hands-on workshops dubbed </span><a href="http://campus.openhatch.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Open Source Comes to Campus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. I&#8217;m curious to learn about analogues to Conservancy and OpenHatch focused on open source hardware. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ll also mention only because there&#8217;s a direct analogue in the </span><a href="http://www.oshwa.org/definition/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Open Source Hardware Definition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that I help maintain the </span><a href="http://opendefinition.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Open [Knowledge] Definition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><strong>What are some interesting news and trends you are seeing in your field and in the Open Source Hardware community? What excites you or causes caution these days?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One trend &#8212; open source computing down to and including the bare metal and supporting infrastructure &#8212; is exactly where open source software and open source hardware fully converge. This isn&#8217;t a new idea, but the exciting thing to me is the emergence of projects which have a long-term but realistic shot at substantially opening huge commercial markets as open source software has for many kinds of infrastructure and developer software. I&#8217;m thinking particularly about RISC-V and the Open Compute Project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What gives me caution is the lack of awareness of the risks exacerbated by non-open source software and hardware and lack of urgency and of adequate strategies for turning things around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The risks are both technical and social, micro and macro. Consider backdoors in CPUs and routers, life-critical systems that can be remote disabled by criminals, states, and vendors, &#8220;smart city&#8221; functions mediated by sensors and software also subject to bad hacking, vendor holdup, and enabling algorithmic discrimination but not subject to public inspection or collaborative improvement by cities and citizens, non-reproducible science (both the exact hardware and software used is crucial), and increased inequality from allowing the most crucial infrastructure of the age to be be controlled and taxed by private parties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The many achievements of open projects in various fields including hardware should be celebrated, but I don&#8217;t mistake these for progress </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">relative</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> to proprietary hardware, software, education, data, science, culture&#8230;there&#8217;s little reason to expect openness to win in the long term. Let me come back to this in the next answer&#8230;</span></p>
<p><strong>What would be the impact of a wider adoption of the principles of Creative Commons and Open Source Hardware, or an open source approach in general, in society, business and public administration?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The impacts would be huge and systemic, but also hard to pin down. Huge and systemic because while the transition from an industrial to a knowledge society has been recognized for decades, its pace seems to be increasing, as illustrated by quips and phrases such as &#8220;software is eating the world&#8221; and &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; and popular discourse about automation and artificial intelligence. It seems obvious (but I&#8217;d love to be convinced otherwise) that the structure of the knowledge economy and knowledge regulation (which very strongly influence each other) are and will increasingly impact a broad range of social outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be flip, we should want software to feed the world and our things to be benevolent &#8212; and not just the software we directly use and things we have on or in our bodies and homes, but also the software and things around us, e.g., those which increasingly constitute the brains and operations of public institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Broad implementation of open source principles can increase freedom, equality, and security simultaneously, each of which is often held to be in tension if not outright conflict with the others. Yochai Benkler in *The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom* (2006) and earlier papers (2002) observed along these lines that this is quite a political feat, an opportunity that would be a great shame to miss out on </span><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2014/02/09/freedoms-commons/"><span style="font-weight: 400">my review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. More recently Jeremy Rifkin in *The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of Things, the Collaborative Commons, and the Eclipse of Capitalism* (2014), Mark Lemley in *Intellectual Property in a World Without Scarcity* (2014; </span><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2014/03/28/ip-post-scarcity/"><span style="font-weight: 400">my review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">), and Paul Mason in *PostCapitalism: A Guide to Our Future* (2015) have written on the possibilities, frequently invoking open source 3D printing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;but realizing these beneficent outcomes rather than more frequently imagined dystopian ones is going to require a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">lot</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> more from open movements. Benkler (2002) nicely put what I think is part of the answer: &#8220;Regulators concerned with fostering innovation may better direct their efforts toward providing the institutional tools that would help thousands of people to collaborate without appropriating their joint product, making the information they produce freely available rather than spending their efforts to increase the scope and sophistication of the mechanisms for private appropriation of this public good as they now do.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Open licenses as currently used for open source software, hardware, etc., are mostly viewed as the prerogative of creators, a matter of one or more of altruism, business strategy, or identity expression. These are undoubtedly necessary, but the sooner the political and ethical focus of open movements moves from these dwarfish forms and occasional defenses (also necessary; </span><a href="http://www.oshwa.org/2015/06/26/oshwa-supports-ownership-in-amicus-brief/"><span style="font-weight: 400">good</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on OSHWA; relatedly see filings from </span><a href="https://sfconservancy.org/news/2015/feb/09/smartTV-DMCA/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Conservancy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and others on smart TVs, medical devices, and more) to convincing regulators that openness should be the prerogative of the public and accordingly implemented as public policy, the better. There is an obvious transition: taking licenses as prototypes for public policy, and mandating their use, also as public policy. Some steps are being taken on the latter, e.g., for publicly funded educational materials I deem </span><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/45872"><span style="font-weight: 400">supporting such efforts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to be Creative Commons&#8217; most important work) and </span><a href="https://www.april.org/en/french-state-it-looks-take-example-free-software"><span style="font-weight: 400">public procurement of software</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Again I&#8217;m very curious to learn about analogous efforts that identify with the open source hardware movement. </span></p>
<p><strong>Which trends and themes in Open Hardware are you seeing in the last year and how will they impact people now and in the future?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not embedded enough in the open source hardware community to usefully comment on trends specifically in the last year &#8212; I&#8217;m hoping to learn a lot at the summit! Hopefully the answers above give some sense of my thoughts on multi-year trends and future impact.</span></p>
<p><strong>Any additional insights, URLs to share, etc.? Feel free to give us your thoughts!</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Doubt everything I wrote above. I </span><a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2015/02/17/annual-thematic-doubt-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400">do</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. You can find me on </span><a href="https://twitter.com/mlinksva"><span style="font-weight: 400">twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> though I use and appreciate an </span><a href="http://identi.ca/mlinksva"><span style="font-weight: 400">open alternative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Are open source hardware topics well documented in Wikipedia? </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Open"><span style="font-weight: 400">WikiProject Open</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> aims to improve articles on all things open, I suspect participation from the open hardware movement would be beneficial.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look forward to talking about pertinent open licensing and open policy developments at OHS, but mostly to learning a lot from other summit attendees!</span></p>
